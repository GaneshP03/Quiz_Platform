# States and Capitals Quiz

## Overview

This project is a terminal-based quiz application written in JavaScript using Node.js. It allows a user to take a quiz on Indian states and their capitals. The user is prompted to answer a series of questions about the capitals of various Indian states. After completing the quiz, the user's score along with their name and roll number is recorded in a file named `scores.txt`.

## Features

- **Randomized Questions**: The quiz questions are randomly selected from a predefined list of states and their capitals.
- **Fixed Number of Questions**: The number of questions to be asked is hardcoded to 5 although in a fully developed application we can alter the number of queestions in the quiz.
- **Score Tracking**: After completing the quiz, the user's score is calculated and saved.
- **File Storage**: User's name, roll number, and score are saved in a file named `scores.txt` so no need of a database connection to store the data.
